          <h2>Why I joined Altschool</h2>
          <p>
            Having served as a non-technical product manager for the past two
            years, I consistently encountered challenges in communication and
            understanding when delving into the development aspects of our
            projects with the engineering team. Recognizing the need to bridge
            this gap and improve collaboration, I joined this software
            development program with the primary goal of gaining a deeper
            understanding of software systems. My aim is to enhance my technical
            knowledge, gain hands-on experience in software development, and
            ultimately become a more proficient product manager.

          <h2>What I aim to achieve</h2>
          <p>
            In pursuit of my professional development, I have set specific goals
            within this program. Firstly, I aspire to evolve into a technical
            software product manager by comprehensively understanding how
            software systems operate. Additionally, I am determined to secure a
            frontend development internship within my current development team,
            aiming to contribute actively to the development process and improve
            my collaborative skills. Ultimately, my plan is not only to increase
            my proficiency as a product manager but also to expand my skillset,
            positioning myself for career growth and an enhanced earning
            capacity.
